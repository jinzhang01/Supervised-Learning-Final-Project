# Supervised-Learning-Final-Project

Project Topic: This project focuses on applying supervised machine learning techniques to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. The dataset contains various features related to the wine's chemical composition, such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol levels, among others. The main task is a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to predict the wine quality, which is rated on a scale from 0 to 10, based on these chemical features.

Project Goal: The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify red wine quality based on its chemical characteristics. By analyzing the relationship between these features and the quality ratings, the project aims to identify the most significant factors influencing wine quality and develop a predictive model that can assist winemakers and consumers in assessing the quality of wine. The models considered include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which will be compared to determine the most effective model for this classification task.
